# Chapter-4-Demo---For-Loops
  
 
 ## Overview

In this chapter, students will learn how to change the flow of their programs based on the computer’s ability to evaluate conditions. Students will see how to create simple and compound conditions. They’ll learn about the if, if-else, and if-elif-else structures, as well as the while loop. Students will also learn about the importance of program planning. In addition, students will see how to generate random numbers to add some excitement to their programs.
