# Chapter-4-Demo---For-Loops
  
 
 ## Overview

In this chapter, students will learn about the concept of sequences. They’ll see that strings are really just sequences of characters. In addition, students will learn how to create a sequence of numbers with the range() function. They’ll learn how to iterate over the elements of a sequence with a for loop, how to get the length of a sequence, and how to check whether an element is a member of a sequence. They’ll discover how to copy sequence elements through indexing and slicing. They’ll also learn about tuples, sequences of any type. Finally, students will learn about immutability and some of the limitations it places on a programmer.
